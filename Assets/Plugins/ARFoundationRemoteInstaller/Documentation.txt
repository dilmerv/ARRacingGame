Installation:
    1. Install AR Foundation >= 3.0.1 and XR providers (ARKit XR Plugin, ARCore XR Plugin, etc.) via Package Manager and ENABLE PROVIDERS(!) in Project Settings -> XR Plug-in Management. 
            Please choose providers compatible with your AR Foundation version.
    2. Check that your existing AR project compiles and works correctly on your AR device.
    3. Import the plugin into your project.
    4. The plugin will install itself automatically after importing it to Unity.
            If automatic installation fails, please fix all Console errors, then select an 'Assets/Plugins/ARFoundationRemoteInstaller/Installer.asset' object and press 'Install Plugin' button.
    5. Add this folder to version control ignore list (.gitignore will be modified automatically): "Packages/com.kyrylokuzyk.arfoundationremote".
            If your repository is private AND you've purchased the license for every team member who will use the plugin, only then you can add plugin's source code to version control system.
            More info about multiple licenses (seats) here: https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/208601846


How to use:
    1. Enable 'AR Foundation Remote' provider in 'Project Settings -> XR Plug-in Management -> PC, Mac & Linux Standalone'.
            If you can't enable this checkbox, please delete the file 'Assets/XR/Loaders/AR Foundation Remote Loader.asset' and try again.
    2. If you're planning to use ARKit Object Tracking, add all your object reference libraries to 'Assets/Plugins/ARFoundationRemoteInstaller/Resources/ObjectTrackingLibraries'
    3. Switch your project to the appropriate build target and press 'Assets/Plugins/ARFoundationRemoteInstaller/Installer/Install AR Companion app' button.
            If your build target requires extension for making builds, add this extension to optionalCompanionAppExtension field.
            Please DO NOT modify the 'Assets/Plugins/ARFoundationRemoteInstaller/Scenes/ARCompanion' scene.
    4. Run 'AR Companion' app on your AR device.
    5. Enter 'AR Companion' app's IP in 'Assets/Plugins/ARFoundationRemoteInstaller/Resources/Settings.asset/AR Companion App IP'.
    6. Run AR scene of your choice in the Editor (or any example scene from 'Assets/Plugins/ARFoundationRemoteInstaller/Scenes/Examples').
            iOS: if connection to your iOS device fails, please try to configure Static IP Configuration: https://www.mobi-pos.com/web/guide/settings/static-ip-configuration
            Your AR device will NOT reflect changes made in Unity Editor. ARCompanion app serves only the purpose of sending AR data and touches back to the Editor.
            Please note that all example scenes consist of pure ARFoundation components. No additional setup was needed for these scenes to work with the plugin.
    7. Leave an honest review on the Asset Store and on forum :)


FAQ:  
    Q: How to update the plugin to a newer version?
    A: Press 'Installer/Un-install Plugin' button, delete the folder 'Assets/Plugins/ARFoundationRemoteInstaller', import the new version, and make a new build of AR Companion app by pressing 'Installer/Install AR Companion App' button.

        More info about this issue: https://forum.unity.com/threads/898433/page-7#post-6607240
    
    Q: How to install the plugin on multiple development machines in an open source project?
    A: Please don't commit plugin files to your public repository.
        Instead, install the plugin on every development machine separately after purchasing the additional licenses: https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/208601846

    Q: Can I build AR Companion app from another (or newly created) project?
    A: Yes! Please ensure that your project has the same version of Unity and same packages (AR Foundation, AR Subsystems, etc.). 
    
    Q: Image Tracking on Android is working unreliably.
    A: The plugin sends reference images from Editor and adds them on AR device at runtime with ScheduleAddImageJob(). 
        While on iOS everything works perfectly fine, image tracking on Android with AR Foundation 4.0.x works unreliably.

        https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples/issues/586
        Solutions:
            1. Please use ARCore 3.x.x or ARCore 4.1.x.
            2. Or add your image libraries to 'Settings/Embedded Image Libraries' and make a new build of the AR Companion app.
    
    Q: I'm trying to run AR Foundation Samples scenes and input remoting doesn't work in SimpleAR and PlaneOcclusion scenes.
    A: These scenes use PlaceOnPlane.cs script which has #if UNITY_EDITOR define. Please remove this define to enable touch input in Editor.
 
    Q: How to connect iOS device to macOS Editor by wire?
    A: Typically, one of the IP addresses displayed in ARCompanion app is an IP of wired connection. Please disable Wi-Fi and there should be one IP left that corresponds to the wired connection.
    
    Q: How to change background video resolution?
    A: To change Editor camera background settings, please go to Assets/Plugins/ARFoundationRemoteInstaller/Resources/Settings.asset.
        Setting higher resolution scale will result in higher latency and lower frames-per-second.
        
    Q: Can I write a custom background video shader and test in the Editor?
    A:  iOS + Windows Unity Editor:
            Make a copy of ARKitBackgroundCustom.shader and modify it as you wish.
        iOS + macOS Unity Editor:
            Make a copy of ARKitBackground.shader and modify it as you wish.
            Please enable 'Project Settings/Player/PC, Mac & .../Other Settings/Rendering/Metal Editor Support'. 
        Android: 
            Unity Editor doesn't support shader features specific for Android (GL_OES_EGL_image_external_essl3, samplerExternalOES), so to test your custom video shader in Editor, 
                this shader should be compatible with both Android and Unity Editor. 
                But, as far as I know, it's not possible to write such shader because Windows/macOS Unity Editor can't run GLSLPROGRAM shaders.

    Q: I get this warning: 'No active UnityEngine.XR.XRInputSubsystem is available'.
    A: This warning is harmless and can be ignored. It's not possible to create XRInputSubsystem in Editor and Unity warns that it's missing.
        If you get other 'No active SUBSYSTEM_NAME is available', it means the plugin does not currently support this AR feature.
        
    Q: How to write a custom camera pose driver and test in the Editor?
    A: Please add this line on top of your script to be able to pull the pose of XRNode.CenterEye:
        using InputTracking = ARFoundationRemote.Runtime.InputTracking;


How to uninstall:
    1. Press 'Installer/Delete AR Companion app build folder' button.
